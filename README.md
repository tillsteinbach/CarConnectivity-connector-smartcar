## CarConnectivity will become the successor of [WeConnect-python](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/WeConnect-python) in 2025 with similar functionality but support for other brands beyond Volkswagen!

[CarConnectivity](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity) is a python API to connect to various car services. This connector enables the integration of  vehicles that are conencted to Smartcar. This connector is meant for vehicles that do not yet have an implementation of a native connector. Look at [CarConnectivity](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity) for native connectors for your vehicle.
