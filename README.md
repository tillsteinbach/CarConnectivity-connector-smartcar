# CarConnectivity Connector for Vehicles integrated in Smartcar


## This is a test for a [Smartcar](https://webflow.smartcar.com/) connector, unfortunately the limitations with [Smartcar](https://webflow.smartcar.com/) are too big. The free account only allows 500 requests per month, which is by far not enough. And it also has heavy rate limiting. If someone wants to give it a try, this repo is a good start.
